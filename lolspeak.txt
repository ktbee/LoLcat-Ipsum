An then Happy Cat sed "Hay guise, y do u think itz beter to do no w0rkz and leeve this kitteh to hurt thn to do teh w0rkz and mak this kitteh not b ded?" An the guise in church, they sed nothingz. An so Happy Cat was mad at teh guise and wanted to pwn them cuz they were actin like n00bs but then Jesus sed to teh hurt kitteh "Hay, giv ur paw to me plz" an teh hurt kitteh did it an then hiz paw waznt difective no morez! An then those guise left frm teh church an tawked to teh other bad guise and were all lyke "omgwtf, Happy Cat needz 2 b pwned."

An then Happy Cat wuz lyke "An if teh devilz like tryed to pwn himself he wud be ded, lolz." "An so if ur a good kitteh and a bad kitteh tryes to com to ur hows and pwn you, teh bad kitteh has to tie u up furst cuz thats teh only wai u wud let teh bad bad kitteh pwn ur stuffz." "An so herez teh thingz, if ur a bad bad kitteh to anothr kitteh an say bad thingz abowt teh kitteh u can stil be frendz wit me an Ceiling Cat, if ur vry vry sry." "An but if ur lyke a bad bad kitteh an u say teh bad thingz about mai frend teh Hovr Cat (wooooooo, lolz i skared u, skaredy kitteh lolz), if u say teh bad thingz abowt teh Hovr Cat, u will be pwnd and pwnd and pwnd 4EVER, even if u say ur sry, so don be bad to teh Hovr Cat, kthx."

Cuz Ceiling Cat is my dad and ur dad and we r all famlee, lolz, srsly." Happy Cat haz teh storee tymes  An so Happy Cat luvd teh oshunfront properteez an he wen thar to teech teh guise about thingz an ther were so many guise there that Happy Cat was like "lolz, too menny guise on teh beech, gtg teech on a boat frm teh oshun, an u guise can lissen frm the beech wich is a pretty sweete deal if u ask me." An so he toght them teh lessunz but it wuz those lessunz that were akshully about one thingz even tho Happy Cat sed the otherz an u had to figur it out urself, wich is hard to do, and he sed: "O hai, so once thar waz a planter gui; An he wuz plantin hiz gardenz an sum of teh seedz got in teh rong playce an the birdz, they cam to eet teh seedz An som of teh seedz they got put on teh roks wich is a dum plaice to plant teh seedz cuz thars no dirt there but teh seedz they groo up newayz An tehn teh sun it came up an teh seedz grone on teh roks, they got pwned bai teh sun cuz sun is too hot 4 teh plantz An some othur seedz, they got put bai teh plantz with teh skary spiky th0rnz an teh th0rnz sux0rx cuz they sckweeze teh plants to ded and teh plantz make no frootz. An sum other seedz they got in teh good dirtz an they groo and groo and mayde teh frootz an made like bazilyunz of frootz." An so Happy Cat sed "Did u here that guise? Or r u guise def?" An hiz 12 frends, latr that dai were lyke "O hai Happy Cat, wtf were you even saying in the boat?" An Happy Cat sed "Hay, u guise are sposed to no wat i was talkn about cuz u hav teh mistery solving skillz, ur lyke sherlok homes an stuff, but those othr guise, the ones on teh beech, they don no teh mistery stuffz so they has to lissen to mai storeez and figur it out themsalvez, lolz." So they can lookz at teh thingz and no wat color those thingz r but not no what it iz an they can here mai wurds and no what teh wurdz r but not get what ahm sayin, but if they r like "o hai Happy Cat an Ceiling Cat, we r vry sry for bein dum, we can haz halp?" then they can undrstand mai storeez. An Happy Cat was like "So guise what ahm sayin is if u don no how to undrstand mai storee about teh planterz then u don know much of nething. So I halpz u guise so u stop bein dum." "Teh. Planterz. Wuz. Plantin. Mai. An. Ceiling. Cats. Wurdz. An so teh seedz were rilly mai an Ceiling Cats wurdz an sumtimes teh devilcat, hez lyke teh burdz in teh storee who takes teh stray seedz awai. An tehn there r teh guise who hav teh stonz 4 grownd and mai w0rdz r sooper cool an they r like "omg, new seedz, these pwn, thx Happy Cat" An but these guise r dum as roks and made of roks so they git excytid about mai wordz jus at furst an then as soone as they hav somethin go rong wit them they r all lyke "omg, Happy Cat, srsly, ur w0rdz sux0rz, they don w0rkz anymoar. thx but nothxbai."

An then there r good guise who r like "O hai Happy Cat, u pwn alwayz even wehn mai lyfe kinda sux0rz so lemme maike u sum frootz an u can hav it for dinnerz, lolz." An then Happy Cat sed "If you haz candel do u put it under a bukkit or under ur bedz? no thats silly, u has to put it on candelstik, rite? An u cant hide nothin frm me or Celing Cat cuz we seez all ur sekritz an moar, lolz, u no how Celing Cat seez u doin things, rotflolz." Happy Cat has moar storee tymes  An Happy Cat was like "O hay guise, I sed for u to lisen" An Happy Cat sed "O hai, I hop u were lisenin cuz ur gonna hav a pop kwiz on this l8r this week, srsly. An if u get a gud grayd, u will git cheezburgz an if u git bad grayds u will git all ur cheezburgz pwned, srsly." An Happy Cat sed "So if u wan to b frends wit me an Ceiling Cat, itz jus lyke bein a planterz and plantin seedz; An seein ur seedz groe and groe, wehn u r sleepin in a sun pach an wehn u r gettin up at all tymes of teh dai n nite, even if u don no how they groe.

Musterd seeds gigant0rz an make big treez an branchiz an all those berdz can be flyin in an undor teh treez an chillin in teh shaydez an stuffz." An Happy Cat jus kept tellin teh guise hiz w0rdz an ovr an ovr jus wit difrent storeez an teh guise herd teh storeez. But Happy Cat he nevr sed teh w0rdz of hizelf an Ceiling Cat unles it was lyke a storeez cuz teh guise were always lyke "Is it can be plz storeez tyme now plzkthx?" An he alwayz xplaynd teh storeez to teh disyplez l8r so they wud no all teh thingz.

But when u see teh abomination ov desolation, spoken ov by Daniel the psychic d00d, standin where it'z not allowed, (r u listenin?) then let them that r n Judaea flee to teh mountainz: If ur on ur roof, don' go in ur house, and don' get ur stuff: An if ur n teh field don't go back for ur jacket. But woe 2 u that haz child, and 2 u that givez suck n thoze dayz! N pray that ur flight iz not n winter. 4 n thoze days shall be worst diseasez evar! N unless Ceiling Cat shortens thoze dayz, no flesh will be spared: unless ur one ov my d00dz. An then if any d00d sayz "Hay! Here iz Christ" or, "Hay! There he iz!" don' listen k: 4 fake Christs and fake psychic d00dz shall rize, and do spellz to trick peoples, maybe even my d00dz. Listen k, I told u this stuff be4. In thoze days, after the skeery timez, the sun n moon r gonna go dark. Starz r gonna fall n Heaven iz gonna shake. Ur gonna see me in teh cloudz with great power n glory. I'm gonna send mah angelz n gather my d00dz from the 4 windz n teh whole sky. Learn from teh fig tree, when teh branch iz tender n putz out leaves, u know summer iz near. When u see teh signz, u know itz gonna happen soon. Srsly, this generashun iz not gonna pass til teh skeery stuff happenz. Heaven n earth will pass away but not my wordz. Nobody knowz when itz gonna happen, not u or u either. Not teh angelz or even me, just Ceiling Cat. L00k out, watch n pray, cuz u dunno what time itz comin. 4 teh Son ov Man iz like a man who took a long trip, who left hiz house n left his servantz n charge, n every man 2 hiz work, n told hiz porter 2 watch. So watch k, cuz u dunno when teh master ov teh house iz comin, at evenin or midnight or dawn or teh mornin. U don' want him 2 find u sleepin, srsly. I say 2 u and 2 everybody, watch.Happy Cat getz katnipsed at Bethany Nao itz two dayses til cheezbrgr feest of Passovers and Unlevennseded Kibls, an soopr relijinkittehs an teh lawkats ar tryin for find speshul sly sekrt sneeky wai of catnap Happy Cat an pwnzor himz.
